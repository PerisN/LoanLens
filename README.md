# LoanLens - BANK LOAN ANALYSIS
LoanLens is a robust analysis project designed to offer valuable insights into bank loan portfolios. 

By leveraging SQL queries, it extracts, transforms, and analyzes data pertaining to loan performance, customer demographics, repayment trends, and risk factors.
These insights are then translated into dynamic visualizations using Tableau, enabling stakeholders to explore loan data visually and uncover key trends and patterns. 

## Purpose
LoanLens empowers banks to make informed decisions regarding risk assessment and portfolio management, ultimately optimizing lending practices and enhancing financial performance.
